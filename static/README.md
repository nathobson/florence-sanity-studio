# Static Preview Images

This directory contains preview images for the page builder blocks. Each block type should have a corresponding preview image named `preview-{blockTypeName}.png`.

## Required Preview Images

Create 300x200px preview images for each block type:

- `preview-imageBlock.png` - Screenshot of an image block
- `preview-textBlock.png` - Screenshot of a text block with rich formatting
- `preview-numberedList.png` - Screenshot of a numbered list
- `preview-quote.png` - Screenshot of a quote block with image and attribution
- `preview-textColumnsWithImage.png` - Screenshot of text columns with images
- `preview-video.png` - Screenshot of a video block
- `preview-audio.png` - Screenshot of an audio block

## Tips for Creating Preview Images

1. Use the same canvas size (300x200px) for consistency
2. Use a clean, minimal design that clearly shows the block's purpose
3. You can create these in Figma by:
   - Creating a 300x200px frame
   - Taking screenshots of actual blocks in your Sanity Studio
   - Pasting them into the frame to ensure consistent sizing
   - Exporting as PNG

## Placeholder

Until you create actual preview images, the block icons will be used as fallbacks.
